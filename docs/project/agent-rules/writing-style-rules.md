## Editorial Rules

Make sure all documents on this project adhere to these principles.
Make edits as needed when editing documents to keep them in alignment with these writing
principles to keep the writing style of this project high.

1. Clear and concise: with absolutely no extraneous words, but casual, not overly stiff
   or formal.

2. Detailed and specific: Avoid vague generalities.
   Use concrete examples and always use quality citations whenever possible.

3. Respectul of the reader’s intelligence: Write for a reader that’s “100% intelligent
   and 100% ignorant.” At the same time, explain concepts (or cite good sources) clearly
   from first principles, but never dumbing things down, being vague, or skipping
   details.

4. Warm: Be friendly in tone.
   Be gracious in acknowledging previous work, even if correcting it.
