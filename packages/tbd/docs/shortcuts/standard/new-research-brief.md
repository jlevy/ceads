Shortcut: New Research Doc

Create a research document in docs/project/research/.

```bash
tbd template research-brief > docs/project/research/research-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
```

Review existing research docs in that directory for context.

Clarify scope with the user, then research and update the document iteratively.
