Shortcut: New Architecture Doc

Create an architecture document in docs/project/architecture/.

```bash
tbd template architecture-doc > docs/project/architecture/arch-YYYY-MM-DD-component-name.md
```

Review existing architecture docs and related specs in docs/project/specs/active/.

Clarify scope with the user: new design vs documenting existing?
Level of detail needed?
