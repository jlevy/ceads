We track work as beads using tbd.
Run `tbd` for more on using tbd and current status.

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Follow the `tbd shortcut precommit-process` steps to review and run pre-commit
   checks.

2. If there are problems, ask for guidance.
   Otherwise, commit directly.
   Do NOT ask the user for permission to commit unless there are problems.
   Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`,
   `chore`, `plan`, `research`, `ops`, `process`. Scope is optional—only add when it
   resolves an important ambiguity.
   (See `tbd guidelines commit-conventions` for details.)

3. If commit is successful and if there is a PR already filed, update the PR
   description.
