Review Section 4 (lines 395-555): Environments — CLI, VS Code, Desktop, Cloud. (1) Verify Cloud-specific considerations are current — check if new env var methods have been added. (2) Confirm the 'export in Bash does NOT work' claim. (3) Verify default models by account type. (4) Check if /model affecting sub-agents behavior has been officially documented since initial writing. (5) Research: Are there new Cloud features or environment configuration options?
