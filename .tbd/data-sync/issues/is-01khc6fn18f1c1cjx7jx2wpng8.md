Review Section 9 (lines 913-1095): Creating Custom Sub-Agent Delegation Frameworks. (1) Verify custom sub-agent creation paths (.claude/agents/, --agents CLI flag). (2) Verify hook-based delegation control (SubagentStart/Stop, PreToolUse/PostToolUse). (3) Verify Task(agent1, agent2) allowlist syntax for coordinator agents. (4) Research: Look for real-world custom sub-agent frameworks people have built and shared on GitHub. Are there plugins, templates, or starter kits for multi-agent pipelines in Claude Code?
