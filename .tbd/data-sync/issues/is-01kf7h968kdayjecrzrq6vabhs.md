Research the best way to provide tbd workflow context to OpenAI Codex and compatible tools through AGENTS.md or similar mechanism. Currently using AGENTS.md file format, but should verify this is optimal.

Tasks:
- Research Codex's AGENTS.md capabilities and best practices
- Determine if Codex has skill-like features beyond AGENTS.md
- Update tbd setup codex if better integration methods are available
