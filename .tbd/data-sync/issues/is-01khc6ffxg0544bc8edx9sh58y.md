Review Section 5 (lines 557-613): Emerging Best Practices for Sub-Agents. (1) Verify Anthropic multi-agent research stats (90.2% improvement, 4x/15x token scaling). (2) Check if Anthropic has published newer multi-agent patterns since Jan 2025. (3) Research: What emerging best practices exist in the broader ecosystem? Look at agent orchestration patterns from: LangChain/LangGraph, Pydantic AI, Microsoft AutoGen/Magentic-One, OpenAI Swarm, Google A2A protocol. (4) Are there trending GitHub repos demonstrating novel sub-agent usage patterns?
