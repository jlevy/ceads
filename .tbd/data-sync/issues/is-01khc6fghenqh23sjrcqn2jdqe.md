Review Section 6 (lines 614-683): Sub-Agent Orchestration Patterns. (1) Verify loop, background, and max_turns patterns are accurate. (2) Verify agent teams experimental status and feature set. (3) Research: Look for trending orchestration frameworks on GitHub — Claude Squad, Gas Town, agent-loop patterns, tmux-based multi-agent runners. (4) Are there new projects implementing loop/iteration patterns over AI agents? Check awesome-claude-code lists and similar curations.
