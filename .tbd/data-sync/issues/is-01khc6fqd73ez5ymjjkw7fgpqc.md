Dedicated research bead for discovering emerging agentic workflow tooling. (1) Search GitHub trending repos for agent orchestration, multi-agent frameworks, and AI coding tool infrastructure. (2) Look specifically at: Claude Squad, Gas Town, agent-protocol, OpenAI Swarm, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen/Magentic-One, Pydantic AI agents, Google A2A, MCP ecosystem tools. (3) Search for projects implementing: outer-loop/Ralph patterns, bead-like issue-driven iteration, custom compaction, handoff protocols, agent-to-agent communication. (4) Check awesome-lists (awesome-claude-code, awesome-ai-agents, etc.) for curated collections. (5) Identify which projects are analogs to patterns in our doc and which represent genuinely new approaches we should cover. (6) Write findings as additions to the References section and potentially new subsections where warranted.
