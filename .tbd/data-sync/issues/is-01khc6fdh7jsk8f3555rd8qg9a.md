Review Section 1 (lines 125-165): Sub-Agent Architecture and Built-in Types. (1) Verify the built-in sub-agent table against current official docs — check if any new sub-agent types have been added since Feb 2026. (2) Confirm the 'sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents' constraint is still accurate. (3) Research: Are there other AI coding tools with similar sub-agent architectures? Look at Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Continue.dev — do they have equivalent delegation systems? How do they compare?
