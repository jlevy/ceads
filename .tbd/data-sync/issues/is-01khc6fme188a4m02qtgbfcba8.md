Review Section 8 (lines 897-911): Comparison table — Native Sub-Agents vs Agent Teams vs Outer Loop. (1) Verify all cells in the comparison table are accurate. (2) Check if agent teams have graduated from experimental status. (3) Consider adding a column for 'Agent SDK programmatic' as a 4th approach. (4) Research: Are there published comparisons of multi-agent coordination approaches across frameworks that we should reference?
