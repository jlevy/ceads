Research the best way to provide tbd workflow context to Cursor IDE through skills or similar mechanism. Currently Cursor uses .cursor/rules/tbd.mdc for rules, but may support more advanced skill integrations.

Tasks:
- Research Cursor's rules/skills capabilities
- Determine if Cursor supports skill frontmatter like Claude Code
- Update tbd setup cursor to install proper skill file if supported
