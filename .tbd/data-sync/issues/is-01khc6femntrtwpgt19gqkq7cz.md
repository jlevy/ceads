Review Section 3 (lines 306-394): Context Transfer Between Parent and Sub-Agents. (1) Verify 'access to current context' claim — confirm which sub-agent types get full conversation history. (2) Verify skills preloading, persistent memory scopes, and resume behavior. (3) Check if any new context transfer mechanisms have been added. (4) Research: How do other agent frameworks handle context passing? Look at shared memory patterns in LangGraph, CrewAI blackboard patterns, OpenAI Swarm handoff protocol.
