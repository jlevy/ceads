Review Key Takeaways (lines 25-98), Recommendations (lines 1600-1657), and References (lines 1673-1751). (1) Verify Key Takeaways still reflect the most important findings after all section reviews. (2) Update Recommendations if new patterns or tools were discovered. (3) Audit all reference links — check for dead links, outdated URLs, and missing citations. (4) Add newly discovered references from the research pass. (5) Update the Next Steps checklist based on what was completed and what new work was identified.
