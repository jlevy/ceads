Review Section 2 (lines 167-305): Model Selection and Control. (1) Verify the 4-level priority chain (env var > Task tool param > per-agent field > inherit) — test or confirm empirically. (2) Check if model alias table is current (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku). (3) Verify cost considerations and the opusplan alias. (4) Research: How do other multi-agent frameworks handle model routing? Look at LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Magentic-One — do they offer per-agent model selection?
