title: Comprehensive testing of TriScript 0.1.6 coverage mechanisms
type: is
updated_at: 2026-01-18T05:59:12.749Z

---
Test the new coverage mechanisms in TriScript 0.1.6 to verify they work correctly.

Suggested approach:
- Check out github.com/jlevy/markform into the attic directory
- Review the CI and build settings in that repo as a reference/comparison
- Ensure coverage reporting is working properly with the new TriScript version
